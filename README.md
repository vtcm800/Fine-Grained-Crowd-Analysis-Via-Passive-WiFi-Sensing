# Fine-Grained-Crowd-Analysis-Via-Passive-WiFi-Sensing
This repository includes three semi-synthetic and one real-world passive WiFi sensing dataset for fine-grained crowd analysis. The fine-grained crowd analysis aims to estimate the density of the whole crowd in a scene and the speeds of local high-density crowds through a certain measurement approache, and particularly, the passive WiFi sensing in [1].
