# Passive-WiFi-Sensing-Based-Fine-Grained-Crowd-Analysis-Dataset
This repository includes three semi-synthetic and one real-world passive WiFi sensing-based datasets for fine-grained crowd analysis. 

The fine-grained crowd analysis aims to estimate the density of the whole crowd in a scene and the speeds of local high-density crowds through a certain measuring approache, and particularly, the passive WiFi sensing is utilized [1]. The basic idea is employing  WiFi sniffers to passively sense nearby pedestrians via capturing probe frames sent by their mobile devices, and then inferring the crowd states from the WiFi measurements in combination with deep learning model(s).

However, there is still a lack of annotated datasets for above tasks. Here we provide three semi-synthetic datasets which are constucted by emulating passive WiFi sensing on precisely labelled pedestrian tracking datasets and a self-collecting real-world dataset in a campus environment.
